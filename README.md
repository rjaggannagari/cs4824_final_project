To run the notebook make sure you have all of the needed python libraries to run it. The needed libraries are listed at the top of the Jupyter Notebook. You will not need to rerun the script for data cleaning, but it is provided to show what data was removed. The clean data and the raw data are both provided for reference.

As far as customizing you will need to change the hard coded values that are in the anime_machine_learning.ipynd. To change the weights for episodes, update the values in cell 3, for score in cell 4, and for rating cell 5. Doing this will change the values of the dataframe and update the output that is computed below. Make sure to restart and run all after changing weights to make sure the new notebook is run and not old parts.
